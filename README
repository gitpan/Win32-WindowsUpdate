NAME
    Win32::WindowsUpdate - Access to Windows Update functions

DESCRIPTION
    Currently only provides the ability to see installed and available not
    installed Windows Updates.

    The intention is to provide the ability to manage all features related
    to Windows Updates, including downloading, installing, uninstalling
    (maybe), and configuring Windows Updates.

    If you test this, please let me know your results. It's not ready for
    production use, but any testing is greatly appreciated.

      my $wu = Win32::WindowsUpdate->new;
      my $updates = $wu->updates;
      my $installed = $wu->installed;

      use Win32::WindowsUpdate;
      my $wu = Win32::WindowsUpdate->new({online => 0});
      my $updates = $wu->updates;
